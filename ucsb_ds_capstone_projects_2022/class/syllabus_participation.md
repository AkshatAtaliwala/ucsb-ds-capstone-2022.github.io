# Meetings and participation

## Class meetings

Each team will collectively keep track of attendance in a shared Google sheet.

We will discuss topics of interest for the whole class during scheduled class times (Mondays 2:00pm-3:15pm PST). Students are expected to attend.

## Team meetings

Team meetings will be central to project work. Students will give weekly updates and receive guidance and suggestions based on their findings.

Each project team will collectively decide on a weekly standing meeting time.
