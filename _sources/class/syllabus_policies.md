# Course policies

## Communication

There are three means of communication outside of class with the instructors, TAs, and other students: Slack, office hours, and email. 

* *Slack* will be your primary communication resource to stay connected with your project team, instructors and course staff, and your classmates outside of scheduled meetings. Your project team will have a private channel for project-related matters and there will be public channels for general-purpose communication.
    
* *Office hours* will be offered on a weekly basis either via Zoom or in person by course staff. These are opportunities to seek help with project-related tasks and course deliverables or to discuss the capstone course more generally and resolve any difficulties that may arise.

* *Email* is a possibility for simple communication regarding personal matters (\textit{e.g.}, needs for special accommodations due to medical or other emergencies), but discouraged for other purposes. In partiular, please refrain from communicating about project content via email, as it is not an efficient medium for advising. 

## Expected time commitment

The course is 4 credit units; each credit unit corresponds to an approximate time commitment of 3 hours. So, expect to allocate 12 hours per week to the course on average, with the majority of your time dedicated to your project. If you find yourself spending considerably more than 12 hours on the course on a regular basis, please let the course staff know so that we can help you balance the workload.

## Conduct 

Please be especially mindful of maintaining respectful and kind communication. Given that some communication will be facilitated online, please bear in mind that this is much more difficult with written communication and consider carefully how your words might be received by others. You are expected to uphold the UCSB student code of conduct; you can find the student code of conduct on the Office of Student Conduct website from [this page](http://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/policies-procedures). If you are uncomfortable with the conduct of another participant for any reason, please notify the instructors or TAs.

Any evidence of problematic academic conduct will be discussed with the student(s) involved and reported to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC). For further information, see the [OSC page on academic integrity](https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity). 

## Accommodations

Reasonable accommodations will be made for any student with a qualifying disability. Such requests should be made through the Disabled Students Program (DSP). More information, instructions on how to access accommodations, and information on related resources can be found on the [DSP website](https://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/). Hybrid remote/in-person learning may present unique accommodation needs requiring additional flexibility; students receiving accommodation via DSP are invited to discuss this with the instructors if desired.

## Student evaluations

Toward the end of the term you will be given an opportunity to provide feedback about the course via ESCI. Your suggestions and assessments are essential to improving the course, so please take the time to fill out the evaluations thoughtfully.

In addition, content-specific feedback will be collected for the Central Coast Data Science Partnership (CCDSP) at the end of the quarter. This information will be used to assess learning outcomes, understand student demographics, and plan further course development; your input on the CCDSP survey is especially valuable, and a small amount of course participation credit will be tied to completion of this survey.
