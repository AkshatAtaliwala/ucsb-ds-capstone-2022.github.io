# Deliverables

## Progress updates

````{margin}
```{note}
Total of three progress updates are required:
* End of week 4
* End of week 7 
* End of week 10
```
````

Each team will create blog-style progress updates about their projects that will be posted on the class website. These serve two goals: (i) practicing written communication; (ii) documenting completed work. 

**Audience**

Updates should be written primarily for an audience of peers (\textit{e.g.} a friend on another project team) and serve to orient them to the project and follow the progress of the team. However, posts may also be read by prospective data science students or collaborators at the sponsor's organization wishing to pick up or build on where the team has left off; so they should be accessible to a general audience as well. 

**Content**

Updates should focus on giving a high-level conceptual view projects, but may require providing background and details in places by defining domain-specific terminology, providing links to external resources, or supplementing discussion with technical endnotes. Peers and project mentors will provide feedback about each update and suggest revisions as needed.

**Posting updates**

Each update will become a part of this class website, which uses [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org), and students will learn how to deploy update pages using GitHub. Jupyter Book pages can be authored with [different types of files](https://jupyterbook.org/file-types/index.html).

* Consider each update as a further step toward your final report and presentation.
* You can continue to modify and improve your updates even after they are posted.
```

In order to create your post, follow these steps:

* Make a fork of the source code of our [class website repository](https://github.com/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021/ucsb-ds-capstone-2021.github.io). You can freely edit this repository without breaking the main class website.
* Share this repository with your teammates to collaborate on the content.
* Build a clone of the class website with your page in place.
* Create a pull request to the main class website for us to review and merge into the main class website!

## End of Quarter Presentations

Each team will give a short slide presentation at the end of the quarter summarizing the current status of their work. Naturally, teams will be at different stages for both the interim (winter) and final (spring) presentations; the goal of the presentation is to efficiently communicate to the class the current status of your team's work.

**Interim (winter) presentation**

Interim presentations should aim to engage the class by focusing on essential background and the central question(s) the team is exploring, along with methodological strategy and any preliminary analysis or results if available. Teams are not expected to have completed any specific project deliverables at this stage. Project mentors will assist in the preparation of presentations by advising on content and providing feedback on draft slides.

**Final (spring) presentation**

Final presentations should aim to summarize for the class the project in end-to-end fashion, including project background and objectives, major efforts and outcomes of completed work, and challenges and future work. While there may be ample further work to complete in some projects, teams will be encouraged to wrap up pending tasks to the best of their ability in the final weeks of the quarter and prepare a summary presentation focusing on what was learned in their research.
