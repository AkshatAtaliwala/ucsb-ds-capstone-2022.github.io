- Begin adding our selected vignette and related files (documentation, code for processing raw data) to this package
- Review each other's pull request and merge after confirming no errors
- From now on, we will utilize Github Project and Actions to make our collaboration flow smoother
- Start exploring datasets from a recommended list provided by NCEAS
